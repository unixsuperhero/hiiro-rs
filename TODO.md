# TODO

- write the code to trigger the subcmd code:
  - internal subcmd
  - external subcmd
- finish a runner for an actual (internal) subcmd

- just start building subcmds for the `note` subcmd
  - to see how it can be abstracted
- add infer method to Subcommand struct
- have builtin subcmds use the lib for determining in/external subcmds
- separate the builtin subcmds from the lib...and move to the bin
  - because they will move with the bin
- subcommands for listing/finding subcommands
